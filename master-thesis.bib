We introduce a novel approach to imaging of quantum many-body systems using matter wave optics to magnify the density distribution prior to optical imaging, allowing sub-lattice spacing resolution in three-dimensional systems. Combining the site-resolved imaging with magnetic resonance techniques for local addressing of individual lattice sites, we demonstrate full accessibility to local information and local manipulation in three-dimensional optical lattice systems. The method opens the path for spatially resolved studies of new quantum many-body regimes including exotic lattice geometries.},

We illuminate individual atoms in free space with resonant light and collect their fluorescence on an electron-multiplying CCD camera using a high-numerical-aperture imaging system. We detect approximately {\textbackslash}num\{20\} photons per atom during an exposure of 20 \${\textbackslash}mu\$s and identify individual atoms with a fidelity of \$99.4{\textbackslash}pm0.3\$ \% . By addressing different optical transitions during two exposures in rapid succession, we additionally resolve the hyperfine spin state of each particle. The position uncertainty of the imaging scheme is 4.0 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m, given by the diffusive motion of the particles during the imaging pulse. The absence of confining potentials enables readout procedures, such as the measurement of single-particle momenta in time of flight, which we demonstrate here.

	abstract = {Quantum walks provide a framework for understanding and designing quantum algorithms that is both intuitive and universal. To leverage the computational power of these walks, it is important to be able to programmably modify the graph a walker traverses while maintaining coherence. Here, we do this by combining the fast, programmable control provided by optical tweezer arrays with the scalable, homogeneous environment of an optical lattice. Using this new combination of tools we study continuous-time quantum walks of single atoms on a 2D square lattice, and perform proof-of-principle demonstrations of spatial search using these walks. When scaled to more particles, the capabilities demonstrated here can be extended to study a variety of problems in quantum information science and quantum simulation, including the deterministic assembly of ground and excited states in Hubbard models with tunable interactions, and performing versions of spatial search in a larger graph with increased connectivity, where search by quantum walk can be more effective.},

The major problems that this paper deals with are determining the minimum number of complete subgraphs of graph G which include all of the edges of G, and determining the minimum number of complete bipartite subgraphs which cover G. The two problems are of a very similar nature. Determining whether there is a projective plane of order p is a special case of the former problem. The latter problem has a natural translation into matrix theory which yields tight upper and lower bounds. An elementary proof is given for Graham's theorem. Two non-obvious classes are given for which the above problems are easily handled; however, this author doubts that these classes can be extended significantly. Two new problems are shown in this paper to be NP-complete. Finally, several conjectures and unsolved problems are posed within the body of the paper.},

To this end, we derive an improved inapproximability result for the biclique edge cover problem. The obtained lower bounds on approximability can be sharpened in the case where the input is given as a deterministic finite automaton over a binary alphabet. This settles most of the open problems stated in [4]. Note that the biclique edge cover problem was recently studied by the authors as lower bound method for the nondeterministic state complexity of finite automata [5].},

	url = {https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003PhDT........61G},
	abstract = {This thesis describes the first all-optical production of a degenerate Fermi gas of atoms. In the experiment, a Magneto-Optical-Trap (MOT ) containing ≃ 1-3 x 108 atoms of 6Li at a temperature of 150 muK is used to load an optical trap formed by the focus of a 65 W CO2 laser beam. The optical potential has a depth of 700 muK and trap oscillation frequencies of 6.6 kHz in the radial direction and 275 Hz in the axial. Approximately 3 x 10 6 atoms are transferred to the optical trap and the MOT is extinguished. A uniform magnetic field of 100 G is applied to the atoms, tuning the s-wave scattering length to ≃ -100 a0. This initiates free evaporative cooling in the sample. After 6s, evaporation has stagnated and 1.3 x 106 atoms remain at a temperature of 50 muK. The intensity of the CO2 laser is then lowered to drive forced evaporative cooling. After 60s of forced evaporative cooling, 1 x 105 atoms remain at a temperature ≤ 4 muK. For this number of atoms, the Fermi temperature, TF = 8 muK. With T/TF ≤ 0.5, the sample is clearly degenerate. In addition to the experimental work, this thesis presents three theoretical results of note: (1) The development of a Monte-Carlo model for simulating a classical or near-classical gas in a Gaussian well. This model extends previous techniques for harmonic wells to a case which approximates the potential well of an optical trap. The application of the model to temperature measurement, trap frequency measurement, and cloud size in an anharmonic potential is presented. (2) The development of a Fokker-Planck approach to studying the evolution dynamics of trap populations in response to fluctuations in the trapping potential. The heating that results from such fluctuations was a primary factor in early failures of optical traps. Understanding these heating processes allowed our group to construct the first optical trap capable of storing atoms for more than a few seconds. (3) The development of an analytical treatment which relates the signal-to-noise ratio of atomic imaging techniques to the physical characteristics of the imaging equipment and the specific imaging technique. This treatment was used to design the imaging system used in the aforementioned experiments.},

We prepare ground state systems consisting of 1 to 10 fermions with fidelities of {\textasciitilde}90\%. This system has the unique property that key parameters such as particle number, inter-particle interactions and external confining potential are tunable. We use this model system to explore two interacting atoms confined in a one-dimensional potential. For increasing repulsion we measure a decrease of the tunneling time of one atom through a barrier which is created by tilting the potential. From the measured tunneling time we calculate the interaction energy of the system using the WKB technique. This requires detailed knowledge of the confining potential, which we obtain by controlling the motional quantum state of a single atom in the trap. To increase the preparation fidelity of the few-particle systems a high-resolution objective has been designed during this thesis. It will allow us to explore tunable quantum systems in two and three dimensions confined in arbitrary potentials. Because of its great tunability our model system is uniquely suited to explore strongly correlated few-fermion systems, which is one of the major challenges of modern physics.},

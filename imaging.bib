	abstract = {High-resolution fluorescence imaging of ultracold atoms and molecules is paramount to performing quantum simulation and computation in optical lattices and tweezers. Imaging durations in these experiments typically range from a millisecond to a second, significantly limiting the cycle time. In this work, we present fast, 2.4‚ÄâŒºs single-atom imaging in lattices, with 99.4\% fidelity - pushing the readout duration of neutral atom quantum platforms to be close to that of superconducting qubit platforms. Additionally, we thoroughly study the performance of accordion lattices. We also demonstrate number-resolved imaging without parity projection, which will facilitate experiments such as the exploration of high-filling phases in the extended Bose-Hubbard models, multi-band or SU(N) Fermi-Hubbard models, and quantum link models.},

	abstract = {We present a versatile imaging scheme for fermionic 6Li atoms with single-particle sensitivity. Our method works for freely propagating particles and completely eliminates the need for confining potentials during the imaging process. We illuminate individual atoms in free space with resonant light and collect their fluorescence on an electron-multiplying CCD camera using a high-numerical-aperture imaging system. We detect approximately 20 photons per atom during an exposure of 20ùúá‚Å¢s and identify individual atoms with a fidelity of (99.4¬±0.3)\%. By addressing different optical transitions during two exposures in rapid succession, we additionally resolve the hyperfine spin state of each particle. The position uncertainty of the imaging scheme is 4.0ùúá‚Å¢m, given by the diffusive motion of the particles during the imaging pulse. The absence of confining potentials enables readout procedures such as the measurement of single-particle momenta in time of flight, which we demonstrate here. Our imaging scheme is technically simple and easily adapted to other atomic species.},

As they are based on atom‚Äìlight interactions, the whole quantum optics toolbox can be used to tailor the detection process to the specific scientific question to be explored in the experiment. Common methods include time-of-flight measurements to access the momentum distribution of the gas, the use of cavities to monitor global properties of the quantum gas with minimal disturbance, and phase-contrast or high-intensity absorption imaging to obtain local real-space information in high-density settings. Even the ultimate limit of detecting each and every atom locally has been realized in two dimensions using so-called quantum gas microscopes. In fact, these microscopes have not only revolutionized detection‚Äîthey have also revolutionized the control of lattice gases.

These phases can be strongly influenced by anisotropic couplings, leading to higher critical temperatures, as emphasized by the recent discovery of superconductivity in nickelates7‚Äì10. Quantum simulators with ultracold atoms provide a versatile platform to engineer such couplings and to observe emergent structures in real space with single-particle resolution. Here we show, to our knowledge, the first signatures of individual stripes in a cold-atom Fermi‚ÄìHubbard quantum simulator using mixed-dimensional (mixD) settings. Increasing the energy scale of hole‚Äìhole attraction to the spin exchange energy, we access the interesting crossover temperature regime in which stripes begin to form11. We observe extended, attractive correlations between hole dopants and find an increased probability of forming larger structures akin to individual stripes. In the spin sector, we study correlation functions up to the third order and find results consistent with stripe formation. These observations are interpreted as a precursor to the stripe phase, which is characterized by interleaved charge and spin density wave ordering with fluctuating lines of dopants separating domains of opposite antiferromagnetic order12‚Äì14.},

        a) Level diagram of the ground and excited states of ${}^6$Li \cite{gehm_preparation_2003}, including the D1 and D2 transitions around $\lambda = 671$~nm. 
        b) Zeeman splitting of the hyperfine levels of the $2\, {}^2\mathrm{S}_{1/2}$ and $2\, {}^2\mathrm{P}_{2/2}$ in ${}^6$Li \cite{serwane_deterministic_2011, sibalic_arc_2017}. As different spin states for physics we consider state $\ket{1}$ and $\ket{2}$, but for imaging it is worth to flip them to stretched states $\ket{6}$, $\ket{3}$. Colored lines indicate transitions driven by radiofrequency (RF) and microwave (MW) fields.

Quantum simulation with ultracold atoms requires both high-fidelity preparation of the initial many-body state and site-resolved measurement of the final state. This thesis presents the development of experimental techniques for spin-resolved free-space imaging and deterministic, spin-selective preparation of ultracold fermionic $^6$Li atoms in a two-dimensional optical tweezer array. The array is generated using crossed acousto-optic deflectors, with precise control achieved through a combination of direct camera-based calibration and atom-based feedback. A novel spilling method enables the preparation of arbitrary spin- and site-resolved occupation patterns. The thesis also introduces numerical tools for simulating Fermi-Hubbard dynamics in small systems, laying the groundwork for future out-of-equilibrium quantum simulation experiments.
